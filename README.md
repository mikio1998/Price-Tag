# Price-Tag

Manually copied entire store inventory into Firestore.
 - Product Fields:
    * Name  
    * Brand
    * Size
    * Color
    * Price

metaData recieved from AVFoundation searches the DataBase for me, 
and gives me the fields I'm looking for (price because I'm clueless, and name/brand too).

For extra the app will also work as a inventory replenishment tool, by recording sales history until
it is reset by the user, when replenishment is complete.

It saves paper, and time, whilst making my job easier.
